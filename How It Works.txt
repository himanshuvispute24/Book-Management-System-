How It Works:
Class BookCollection:

Uses a dictionary (self.books) to store book titles as keys and their quantities as values.

Methods:

add_book: Adds a new book or updates the quantity of an existing book.

remove_book: Removes a specified quantity of a book or deletes it if the quantity reaches zero.

view_collection: Displays all books and their quantities.

get_total_books: Calculates and displays the total number of books in the collection.

Menu-Driven Interface:

The main function provides a loop to display the menu and handle user input.

Users can add books, remove books, view the collection, get the total count, or exit the program.

Input Validation:

Ensures book titles are non-empty and quantities are positive numbers.

Prevents removing more books than are available.
